# Connect-K Tournament Bot

Connect-K is a two-player game similar to Connect-4 but generalized â€” players alternately drop pieces into columns and attempt to be the first to connect K of their pieces in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). A game ends when a player connects K pieces or the board fills (draw).

## Overview
The project provides a lightweight, reproducible environment to develop, test, and compete bots that play the generalized Connect-K game (like Connect-4 but with a configurable K). It bundles a compiled tournament engine that orchestrates matches and a simple Python bot interface so participants can focus on writing game logic and strategies without worrying about wiring, matchmaking, or rule enforcement.
